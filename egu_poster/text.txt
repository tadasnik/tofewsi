Can extreme burning events in Indonesia be predicted? This study, part of the
ToFEWSI project, explored predictive skill of machine learning algorithms using
fire weather and forest cover change datasets as inputs. 
Some of the forest cover change datasets used for model training. Derived from Hansen et al., 2013, Science 342.
Canadian Fire Weather indices were calculated from the ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis dataset.

Logistic regression, Maxent, support vector machines and neural network
algorithms were trained to predict fire occurrence on 25km grid and monthly
time step for 2002 - 2018 period 2018 period.  

Results indicate very good prediction skill for most years when models were trained with full feature set.
Conversion of primary rainforest to other uses was linked to increased fire occurrence probability.

The scores were consistent, but generally better during higher fire activity years.

The results demonstrate feasibility of fire activity predictability on seasonal scales using long-range forecasting systems such as ECMWF SEAS5.
